# TernOS

TernOS is an open-source operating system that is engineered for *everyone*. TernOS is minimal, simple to use and yet powerful enough for all tasks you throw at it.

## Goals

- Minimal desktop environment.
- Clean and clear codebase.
- Easy build systems and proper documentation.

## Trying TernOS

TernOS currently does not provide any bootable images, since we are not that far with development. Check back soon.

## Compiling TernOS

See the `ReadMe.Compiling_Linux`.
